- Optimized cpu and memory management in a Linux HPC environment by configuring resource-intensive processes to dynamically adjust cpu allocation based on memory-related errors. Implemented limits to prevent resource contention and balance compute availability across the network.
- Guided a global engineering team by delegating technical tasks, conducting code reviews, promoting modular software designs, and code coverage thresholds for CI/CD in Azure Devops (ADO).
- Collaborated with software architects, project managers, bioinformaticians, and product owners in an Agile environment to translate internal customer needs into extensible, maintainable software, aligned with IT architectural standards and designed for scalability.
